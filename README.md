# ck-signal-table

## Introduction

This is a Kvaser CanKing extension showing CAN signal values in a table.

This project shows how to create a simple extension. It is using the
```SelectSignalsControl``` for selecting signals from DBC files and a Material-UI
Table component for showing the data.

It also uses the useSignalData hook to subscribe on signal updates.

## Installation

If you want to run this extension inside CanKing then follow these steps:

1. Download the ck-signal-table-1.0.0.tgz file from the v1.0.0 release
2. Start CanKing and select ```More->Extensions->Install...```
3. Select the file and click Open

The 'Signal Table' view will now be available inside CanKing.
