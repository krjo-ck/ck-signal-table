# ck-signal-table

## Introduction

This is a Kvaser CanKing extension showing CAN signal values in a table.

This project shows how to create a simple extension. It is using the
```SelectSignalsControl``` for selecting signals from DBC files and a Material-UI
Table component for showing the data.

It also uses the useSignalData hook to subscribe on signal updates.
